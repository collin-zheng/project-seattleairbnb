## Motivation <a name="libraries"></a>

As a keen traveller and investor, I'm interested in the AirBnb market for cities around the world. Here, we take a look at the Seattle market. We focus on three questions:

1. What are the pricing trends across the year?
2. What's the popularity for different property types?
3. Which features best predict AirBnb prices?

## Data & Libraries <a name="requirements"></a>

The project was prototyped in Jupyter Lab using Anaconda 1.0.2, which uses Python 3.6. Important libraries include: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn.

Three tables are used for the analysis: calendar.csv, listings.csv and review.csv.
