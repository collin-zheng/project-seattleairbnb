## Motivation <a name="libraries"></a>

As a keen traveller and investor, I'm interested in the AirBnb market for cities around the world. Here, we take a look at the Seattle market. For this project, I looked at four questions:

1. How do the Airbnb rental prices vary seasonally?
2. What types of properties are the most popular?
3. How does cancellation policy affect a rental?
4. How does host response times affect a rental?

## Data & Libraries <a name="requirements"></a>

The project was prototyped in Jupyter Lab using Anaconda 1.0.2, which uses Python 3.6. Important libraries include: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn.

Three tables are used for the analysis: calendar.csv, listings.csv and review.csv.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

In short, I found that the median prices of rentals were the highest in summer; that apartments and houses were the most common rentals, and also the most popular; that the most popular rentals had the most generous cancellation policies; and that the most popular rentals had the quickest enquiry response time by their hosts.
